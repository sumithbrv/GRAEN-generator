Graen generator is a new type of electricity generator which converts gravity into electricity directly ( without using a running resource).

My name is Sumith. I am an alumnus of IIT Madras and Cornell university, New york. I lead a startup called MAGWORKS.

It took me 14 years of research to come with the design of GRAEN generator. The design is already in open source and can be found in the link 
below.

Please find below link to an animation video which shows how the generator functions.

Please read the paper first and then have a look at the animation video for complete understanding. GRAEN generator is non-polluting and does 
not consume running water resource. It can provide electricity at a very low price and protect humanity from dangers of global warming/climate
change. I plan to go open source with the implementation ( i.e. construction of prototype) too.

I want the GRAEN generator to work everywhere on the planet (from cold polar regions to hot deserts).
